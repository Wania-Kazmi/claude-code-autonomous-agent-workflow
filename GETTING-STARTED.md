# Getting Started with Claude Code Autonomous Agent Workflow

Welcome! This boilerplate is ready to use. Follow these steps to get started.

---

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before your first run, verify:

- [ ] **Claude Code CLI installed**: `claude --version`
- [ ] **Python 3.8+** (for TODO sync): `python3 --version`
- [ ] **Git initialized**: Already done in this boilerplate
- [ ] **Spec-Kit-Plus pre-installed**: `.claude/` and `.specify/` directories exist
- [ ] **Clean slate confirmed**: No session-specific files exist (fresh start)

---

## 🚀 First-Time Usage

### Step 1: Create Your Requirements File

```bash
# Copy the example
cp requirements/example.md requirements/my-app.md

# Edit it with your project requirements
# (Use your preferred editor)
```

### Step 2: Run Autonomous Build

```bash
claude "/sp.autonomous requirements/my-app.md"
```

This will:
1. Verify Spec-Kit-Plus installation (must be pre-installed)
2. Analyze your requirements
3. Generate missing skills/agents/hooks (if needed)
4. Create project specification
5. Build implementation plan
6. Generate code with tests
7. Run quality reviews

**Note**: `/sp.autonomous` assumes Spec-Kit-Plus is already installed. The `.claude/` and `.specify/` directories must exist before running this command.

### Step 3: Resume Work After Days/Weeks

When you start a **new conversation** later:

```bash
# See your saved TODOs from last session
bash .claude/scripts/resume-work.sh

# Ask Claude: "Please restore these TODOs"
```

## 📂 What You'll See Created

## 🔄 Multi-User Collaboration

If multiple developers work on this project:

### Developer A (First Session)
```bash
# Works on project, creates TODOs
# Session ends → TODOs auto-save to .specify/todos.json
```

### Developer B (Next Session)
```bash
# Starts new conversation
bash .claude/scripts/resume-work.sh

# Output shows:
# "👥 Collaborative: 2 session(s) contributed"
# "Last Contributor: session-a"

# Ask Claude to restore TODOs
# Continue work, add more TODOs
# Session ends → Intelligent merge with A's TODOs
```

### Developer A (Returns)
```bash
# Starts new conversation
bash .claude/scripts/resume-work.sh

# Sees combined work from both sessions
# TODOs show 👥2 badge for items both worked on
```

See [`.claude/docs/MULTI-USER-COLLABORATION.md`](.claude/docs/MULTI-USER-COLLABORATION.md) for details.

## 📚 Key Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [README.md](README.md) | Overview and architecture |
| [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) | Production-ready configuration reference |
| [SESSION-RECOVERY.md](.claude/docs/SESSION-RECOVERY.md) | TODO persistence system |

## 🎯 Your First Task

Try this to test the system:

```bash
# 1. Create a simple requirements file
cat > requirements/hello-world.md << 'EOF'
# Hello World API

## Requirements
- Create a REST API with a single endpoint: GET /hello
- Returns: {"message": "Hello, World!"}
- Use Express.js
- Include tests with 80%+ coverage
EOF

# 2. Run autonomous build
claude "/sp.autonomous requirements/hello-world.md"

# 3. Watch it work!
```

The system will:
- ✅ Detect Express.js requirement
- ✅ Generate express-patterns skill (if missing)
- ✅ Create API specification
- ✅ Build implementation with tests
- ✅ Run code review
- ✅ Verify 80%+ coverage

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Clean Slate vs Session Recovery

- **First time using this boilerplate?** You start with a clean slate (no TODOs)
- **Returning after days?** Run `bash .claude/scripts/resume-work.sh`
- **Working with teammates?** Commit `.specify/todos.json` to share TODO state

### What's Ignored by Git

These files are session-specific and NOT committed:
- `.specify/todos.json` (your active TODO state)
- `.specify/todo-history/` (historical snapshots)
- `.specify/workflow-state.json` (workflow phase tracking)
- `.claude/logs/*.log` (usage logs)

See `.gitignore` for full list.

### What's Committed

These files ARE shared via git:
- All skills (`.claude/skills/`)
- All agents (`.claude/agents/`)
- All hooks (`.claude/hooks.json`)
- Documentation
- Settings and rules
- Example files (`.specify/todos.example.json`)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No saved TODOs found"
**Normal for first-time use!** TODOs are created when you first use the TodoWrite tool.

### "Unknown skill: X"
Some skills are generated on-demand during the workflow. This is expected.

### Build Fails
1. Try: `claude "/build-fix"`
2. Check: `claude "/code-review"`
3. Review errors in `.claude/logs/`

### TODOs Not Merging
Check that `Stop` hook is configured in `.claude/settings.json` (it is by default).

---

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Start Simple**: Run the Hello World example above
2. **Review Generated Code**: See what skills/agents were used
3. **Check Logs**: Look at `.claude/logs/skill-invocations.log`
4. **Try Collaboration**: Simulate multiple sessions
5. **Build Real Project**: Use your actual requirements

## 🤝 Need Help?

- **Documentation**: Check the `/docs` directory
- **Examples**: See `requirements/example.md`
- **Issues**: Open a GitHub issue
- **Questions**: Ask Claude! It knows this system intimately.

**Ready?** Run `claude "/sp.autonomous requirements/my-app.md"` and watch the magic happen! ✨
