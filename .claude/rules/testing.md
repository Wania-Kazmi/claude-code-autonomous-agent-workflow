# Testing Requirements

## Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows (Playwright)

## Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:
1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

## TDD Cycle

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → REPEAT

RED:      Write a failing test
GREEN:    Write minimal code to pass
REFACTOR: Improve code, keep tests passing
REPEAT:   Next feature/scenario
```

## Edge Cases to Test

- Null/undefined inputs
- Empty arrays/strings
- Boundary values (min/max)
- Error conditions
- Race conditions
- Large data sets

## Coverage Requirements

- **80% minimum** for all code
- **100% required** for:
  - Financial calculations
  - Authentication logic
  - Security-critical code
  - Core business logic

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Use **tdd-guide** agent
2. Check test isolation
3. Verify mocks are correct
4. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

## Agent Support

- **tdd-guide** - Use PROACTIVELY for new features, enforces write-tests-first
- **e2e-runner** - Playwright E2E testing specialist
